# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design
 Here I'll post the projects I'm developing for freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification.
 
+ Tribute Page
:two_hearts: status : finished. Build a simple tribte page to one of my favourite progressive rock albums: Obsolete. Very simple page, cute colours, cute aesthetic. It took me a while to figure out what to pay homage to so I decided to chose music, which is very important to me.

+ Survey Form

+ Product Landing Page
